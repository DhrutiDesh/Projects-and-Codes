# Sales Data Analysis and Power BI Dashboards

This project involves the cleaning, transformation, and analysis of sales data sourced from Kaggle datasets. The project leverages advanced SQL querying techniques and Power BI dashboards to derive actionable business insights for optimizing revenue and planning inventory.

## Project Overview

The sales data was cleaned and transformed using advanced SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions. These transformations were performed to ensure the dataset was ready for detailed analysis and visualization. The end goal of the project was to create interactive Power BI dashboards that track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:
